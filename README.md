# Customer Success

This repository contains tasks and requests for Customer Success and the Cal-ITP CRM, Hubspot.
Customer Success is a Cal-ITP function that provides transit agencies with the resources and technical assistance they need to take advantage of Cal-ITP's various services. Typically, this is done through proactive outreach (campaigns) with customers and reactive customer support (support tickets). The CRM is a crucial tool managed and maintained by the Customer Success team. The CRM ensures that the Cal-ITP team has a reliable database of contact information, communication history, workflows, shared inboxes, reports, and more.
