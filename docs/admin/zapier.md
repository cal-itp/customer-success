# Zapier

We use Zapier to connect the CA Mobility Marketplace website forms to Hubspot Services. There are two forms; Contactless Payment Support and Contact Form which uses Zapier to import the contact, company and service data into Hubspot.

Zapier uses the bot@calitp.org account to manage all connections. Below is the current list of Zapier connections:

In order to update and change these connections you will need to login in through the Google sign-in using bot@calitp.org account. Any update to the connections can be done by Anthony Rollins through the creation of a Github issue in [/crm-helpdesk](https://github.com/calitp/crm-helpdesk) repo
