# Reports

We have the ability to create custom reports that allow us to analyze activities and objects. Reports can be saved to the reports list, a dashboard, or they can be exported. 
We also have the ability to create custom dashboards that combine multiple reports. These can be high-level dashboards used to share information and metrics with stakeholders, or more detailed dashboards for teams to track progress in specific areas. 

Currently, there are five dashboards that have been created. See the table below for details on our current dashboards.

| Dashboard | Description |
|:----------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Monthly Reports | An overview of general monthly activity |
| Payment Pipeline Details | An overview of the Payments Pipeline |
| Account Manager Overview | A preview of activity within cohort agency records within the past 15 days |
| Monthly Reporting | An overview of activity by user company |
| Deals Pipeline Progress | An overview of deal activity in all pipelines |
