# Imports

Importing data into Hubspot is a quick and easy way to add records and data into the CRM or to update existing records in bulk. We have conducted several imports to ensure preexisting Caltrans data is available, such as data from Blackcat, Constant Contact, past CRMâ€™s and more. To view past imports, click [here](https://app.hubspot.com/import/5519226). 


## Requesting Data Imports

If you would like to add new data into Hubspot, please open up a blank [Github issue](https://github.com/cal-itp/crm-helpdesk/issues/new). In the Github issue, attach a .csv file with the import data or explain what data you want added as that data might already exist.
