# Feedback Surveys
Hubspot gives you the ability to create custom feedback surveys to send to contacts. You can create custom questions and choose from several different answer options, such as including star ratings, radio selects and single line text fields. Surveys can be delivered in the form of emails or shareable links. 

*Note: To send an email survey, users must have Marketing access permissions, including ```Publish``` access to the ```Email``` tool. If you do not have access to feedback surveys, please contact the CRM team.*
