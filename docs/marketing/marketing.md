# Marketing

Hubspot Marketing is made up of tools and features to reach out to your external audiences. You can use Hubspot to track your ad campaigns, email campaigns, social media outreach and manage your web forms, and landing pages. Cal-ITP uses its email marketing capabilities and its lead generation forms. 

## Email Marketing
Cal-ITP uses Hubspot Marketing as our email marketing tool. We have sent out one email using the email feature, and have plans to add two new emails to Hubspot; Monthly GTFS Quality Reports and Cal-ITPâ€™s newsletter. Using Cal-ITPs branding, we have created one email template that will be used for all email marketing.
