# Deal Pipelines

Deals pipelines are created to track progress, communication, and other important information for various initiatives and campaigns. Below is a list of all current Deal Pipelines. The charts below indicate the uses of our current pipelines. Pipelines can be added when a new workflow would benefit from this action. New pipelines can be created by opening an [issue on Github](https://github.com/cal-itp/customer-success/issues/new?assignees=&labels=deals-pipeline&template=deals-pipelines-request-form.yml&title=%5BDeals+Pipeline+Request%5D%3A+) using our deals pipeline template.
