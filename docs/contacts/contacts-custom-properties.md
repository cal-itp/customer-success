# Custom Properties

Contacts also have the ability to be defined even more specifically with custom properties such as job role or title, these properties allow us not only to have knowledge of our contact, but also allows us to filter that contact should we have specific communication or initiatives that need to be received by a specific department. As the CRM continues to be built out, additional custom properties can be added to reflect the needs of the Cal-ITP team.

**Current Custom properties**

| ------- | ------------ |
| `job_role` | Dropdown multi-select field to determine the contacts role at the company (Data, Executive, Grants, etc.) |
