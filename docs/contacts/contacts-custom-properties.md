# Custom Properties

Contacts have the ability to be further refined using custom properties, such as job role or title. These properties allow us not only to have knowledge of our contact, **but also allows us to filter by the property if specific reporting is needed to be received by a specific department. As the CRM continues to be built out, additional custom properties can be added to reflect the needs of the Cal-ITP team.
