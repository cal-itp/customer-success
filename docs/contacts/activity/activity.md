# Activities

Activities are interactions that a team member has had with a contact and are recorded on that recordâ€™s timeline. Activities include emails, calls, tasks, notes and meetings. Activities also have the ability to be filtered so that team members can view last communication, ticket replies, or a variety of other helpful updates.
