# Website Domain as Unique Identifier

Companiesâ€™ unique identifier is the website domain. Website domains are the portion after "www." for a web address or after the @ symbol for an email address. In our case, this is often the name or abbreviation of the agency, vendor, or organization. Utilizing a website domain as the unique identifier allows for multiple contacts to be associated with the company record as they all share emails with the same email domain.

## Managing Multiple Domains

Some agencies may have multiple domains such as a public facing domain or a branded domain. Their primary domain should be based on the domain name that we receive emails from and are the most service oriented domain. All related domains and URLS should be listed within the main company record and can be associated with the main company.
