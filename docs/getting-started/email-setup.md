# Email Setup

Logging emails is central to Hubspot’s ability to track interactions and allows for greater transparency, providing an opportunity for team members to have a deeper understanding of where a relationship is at. Once configured, Hubspot email logging allows to set up automated and/or selective logging of emails while you are in your preferred email tool.

Hubspot email logging can happen one of two ways; you can either set up your email within Hubspot, or you can install the [Hubspot email extension](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/connected-email/how-to-install-hubspot-sales). There is an option to log your emails into the system, but is not the preferred method. You can find more details on logging in the [Activities section](https://docs.calitp.org/crm-helpdesk/contacts/activities).

For those who don’t have access to add your email to Hubspot, there’s a backup option to ensure communication is continuously tracked within Hubspot. Cal-ITP created [crm@calitp.org](mailto:crm@calitp.org) to bring all conversations into Hubspot by simply cc’ing this email in any of your communication. Ensure the crm@ email is CC’d, as we want all back and forth conversations to be tracked in the CRM.

**Note:** The email set-up function currently does not work for `@dot.ca.gov` emails – we are actively working with Caltrans IT staff to resolve this issue.
