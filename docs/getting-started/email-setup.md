# Email Setup

Logging emails is a central activity to Hubspot and allows for greater transparency and provides an opportunity for team members to have a deeper understanding of where a relationship is at. When configured Hubspot email logging allows to set up automated and/or selective logging of emails while you are in your prefered email tool

Hubspot email logging can happen in two ways, you can either set up your email within Hubspot, or you install the [Hubspot email extension](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/connected-email/how-to-install-hubspot-sales). More details on logging will be found in the Activities section.

For those who don’t have access to add your email to Hubspot, there’s a backup option to ensure communication is continuously tracked within Hubspot. Cal-ITP created, [crm@calitp.org](mailto:crm@calitp.org), to bring all conversations into Hubspot by simply cc’ing this email in any of your communication. Ensure the crm@ email is CC’d, as we want all back and forth conversations to be tracked in the CRM.

**Note:**: The email set-up function currently does not work for @dot.ca.gov emails – we are actively working with Caltrans IT staff to resolve this issue.
