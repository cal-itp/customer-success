# What is a CRM
A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform is a way to track relationships with customers. Typically, this is done by storing data, such as contact information and other insights about a customer (recent emails, meetings, phone calls, etc.). CRMâ€™s can be found in many forms, but at Cal-ITP, we use Hubspot for our CRM. Within Hubspot are multiple products that allow us to build out our CRM: service, sales and marketing. These products, and our context for usage, are detailed in this guide.
