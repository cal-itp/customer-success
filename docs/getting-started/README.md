# What is a CRM

A Customer Relationship Management platform, well-known as a CRM, is a way to track relationships with customers. Typically, this is done by storing data, such as contact information and other insights about a customer (recent emails, meetings, phone calls, etc.). CRM’s can be found in many forms, but at Cal-ITP, we use [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/) for our CRM. Within Hubspot are multiple products that allow us to build out our CRM: *service, sales and marketing*. These products, and our context for usage, are detailed in this guide.

For team members, the value of the CRM is driven by consistent usage and approaching the tool with a collectivist mindset. When we integrate the CRM into our workflows across multiple team members, we can build more dynamic profiles, create links between teams, work more efficiently, and elevate our communication both internally and externally. This document seeks to provide context and training so that team members can easily adopt the CRM into our workflows and develop consistency in our usage.

## Purpose

The CRM’s purpose is to increase the effectiveness of Cal-ITP’s relational communication and outreach efforts by establishing transit provider and organization profiles and contact records that detail past and current communication activity such as emails, phone calls, deals (payment pipeline, transit data pipeline, etc.) and support tickets.
